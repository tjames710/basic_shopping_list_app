# basic_shopping_list_app

 **shopping_list.py** was intended to get something working.
 
 **shopping_list2.py** Is where I added functions and refactored code. This is 
 a small project with very minimal functionallity. This was more practice of making 
 functions in Python and build a working application, also was used for practice using 
 version control.
